<strong><i>Introduction</strong></i>  <br>
This submission is a project which I produced as apart of my ongoing studies at GMIT for my course "H. Dip in Data Analytics".
<br>
The nature of this project is to portray the knowledge gained relating to REST API's during my studies within this module. <br>
<br>

<strong> What is needed to recreate this project? </strong> <br>

<ol>
  <li> Python package </li>
  <li> Command line interpreter application e.g. Command Prompt, Cmder, Terminal (many more available) </li>
</ol>
<br>

* I have been using Python for the last 18 months on my machine so I previously installed Python using the Anaconda suite (see https://www.anaconda.com/)

* Computers can come with a pre-installed command line interpreter app based on their operating system. Windows has Command Prompt and Mac has Terminal. There are other alternatives available should you wish to install them from the internet. I have always chosen to use the built in application purely to keep things simple with my studies.
