<strong><i>Introduction</strong></i>  <br>
This submission is a project which I produced as apart of my ongoing studies at GMIT for my course "H. Dip in Data Analytics".
<br>
The nature of this project is to portray the knowledge gained relating to REST API's during my studies within this module. <br>
<br>

<strong> What is needed to recreate this project? </strong> <br>

<ol>
  <li> Python programming language </li>
  <li> A command line interpreter application </li>
  <li> MySQL </li>
</ol>
<br>

* I have been using the Python language for the last 18 months on my machine through my studies so I already have Python software installed through the Anaconda suite. [1]

* Computers can come with a pre-installed command line interpreter app based on their operating system. Windows has Command Prompt and Mac has Terminal. There are other alternatives available should you wish to install them from the internet. I have always chosen to use the built in application purely to keep things simple with my studies. 

* Once installed, you can make calls to Python through the command line in order to carry out desired requests. [2] [3]

* MySQL is an open-source database management system which I have chosen to use as apart of this project. [4]

* Finally, I chose to use Visual Studio Code as the software to write and test my code for this project. [5]
